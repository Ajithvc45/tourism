The city comprises beautiful beaches, long stretches of palm fringed shorelines, windy backwaters and historical structures. Along with its natural and historical significance, the city is also popular for its ancient temples that are renowned for their architecture making Thiruvananthapuram one of the most visited pilgrim centers of India. <br> <br>

                        In the late 17th century, the city was the capital of the Travancore kingdom that was ruled by the Varma dynasty. After forming the Travancore kingdom, Maharaja Marthanada Varma dedicated it to Lord Padmanabha, the presiding deity of Shri Padmanabhaswamy temple and named the city ‘Thiruvananthapuram’. <br> <br>
                        
                        The word ‘Thiruvananthapuram’ is derived from the Malayalam word thiru- anantha-puram, which means ‘City of Lord Ananta’. Ananta is the serpent Shesha on whom Lord Padmanabha (another form of Lord Vishnu) reclines. During the British era, the name of the city was anglicized to Trivandrum and it was the official name of the city, until 1991, when the government renamed the city to Thiruvananthapuram. <br><br>

                        The place of worship has lent its names to the capital city as ‘Thiru’ ‘Anantha’ ‘Puram’, which means Sacred Abode of Lord Anantha Padmanabha. Dravidian style of architecture is prominent in this holy structure.
                        
                        The chief attraction is the deity of Padmanabhaswamy, enshrined in a reclining posture. However, the main deity remains that of Lord Vishnu and his heavenly consorts namely, Sridevi and Bhudevi. The sacred idol is covered with a special ayurveda mixture that helps in keeping the plaster intact and clean. Devotees donate a large sum of money and precious articles in this temple. The assets are believed to be value around 90,000 crores.  The invaluable donations are kept safe in 6 different cellars.
